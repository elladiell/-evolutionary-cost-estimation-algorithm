# -evolutionary-cost-estimation-algorithm

There was a task - to estimate the cost of a software project. 
I have chosen 13 projects as learning set and making algorithm with such characteristics:
- the type of evolutionary algo is swarm algorithm;
- coding solution is a real vector;
- fitness-function is ED (euclidean distance)

I have to learn machine 4 times or more for better results.
